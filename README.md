# Select Mode Pie Menu Blender Addon
- Simple script to call pie menu for Select modes in edit mode
- Tested on version 4.5.0 but probably works seamlessly on older ones
- even though the script is heavily vibe-coded (shame on me hehe) ...I wanted to share because I find it very useful

# How to install to Blender
- open preferences > add-ons > install from disk > select downloaded .py file
- You can change keybind; it's called "open select mode pie" (I personally prefer mouse5 since it's super efficient)
